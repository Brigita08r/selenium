# Practicing web testing with Selenium
I have decided to find out more about Selenium and learn some more information.

I will be adding here different kind of excercises for practicing selenium testing.
Mainly for http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/ page. 
It contains various page structures/functions to test.

For now, all the testing is done in one MainClass.
However, in a future I plan to write tests for real existing pages and
then I will be using some more classes as well as Page Object Model and Page Factory.
So my tests are more readale and not all methods are placed in one java.class only.
